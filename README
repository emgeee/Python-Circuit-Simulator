myspice.py reads in a SPICE compatible file, analyzes the netlist for errors,
then runs a simulation on the circuit if it is of a series topology. The
program uses Euler's method for it's analyzes and displays a plot of the
voltage versus time.

Required Software:
	Python 2.7
	matplotlib
	numpy

FEATURES:
	Sanity check using ngspice - the spice simulation was run using
		ngspice and the results were compared to the developed
		script.

KNOWN ISSUES:
	There appears to be a descrepency in precision between between floating
	points in Python and whatever langauge generated the sample reports file.
	The values appear to be slightly different different due to differences
	in rounding and precision between the two languages.
